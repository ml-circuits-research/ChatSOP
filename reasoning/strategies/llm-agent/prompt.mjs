const CONVENTIONS = `Reasoning conventions (the engine's documented semantics; follow them exactly):
- Evidence is four-valued per fact: supported (only positive evidence), refuted (only explicit negative evidence, or the fact is absent from a predicate declared closed over a complete list), both (positive and negative evidence together; nothing else breaks), unknown (no evidence either way). Absence of evidence is unknown, never false, unless the list is stated to be complete (closed).
- "absent p a" (negation as failure) is allowed only over a closed (complete) list; "not p a" is explicit negative evidence.
- A count or a sum over a relation that is not stated to be complete is a LOWER BOUND: report the number of known answers with bound "at_least". Over a complete (closed) relation the count is exact and has no bound field.
- A universal question (mode every) over a domain that is not complete and without a counterexample is "unknown" with reason "open_domain"; a counterexample refutes it. Over a closed domain with no counterexample it is supported.
- A count counts DISTINCT bindings (duplicates collapse). Integers only; division rounds toward zero as integers do.
- Defaults ("normally", "usually"): a default concludes its head unless an exception applies, a strict (explicit) contrary fact refutes it, or a default of higher priority concludes the contrary. Two defaults of equal strength with contrary heads give status both. An overriding default blocks the other by firing, not by merely applying.
- Reported, hedged or supposed facts are assumptions: if the answer depends on any of them it is conditional, and you list them. Rules are laws; they have no exceptions.
- Time: a fact with a validity interval holds from its start (inclusive) to its end (exclusive). A derived fact holds only while all its premises hold at the same instant. "throughout/during S E" means at every instant of the period; "overlaps" at some instant; "asof D" means as known on date D (use the versions of rules and procedures approved and in force on D).
- Planning: a plan is the cheapest sequence of actions that achieves the goal, respecting all requirements, hard norms (forbid, oblige hard) and strict methods; soft obligations that cannot be met cost their stated penalty. A choice inside a method is optimised; outside it a strict method allows no other actions. If no legal plan exists but one would exist if named norms or unmet requirements were waived, the status is blocked and blocked_by names them (for an unmet requirement blocked_by is empty and blocked gives the step and the requirement); if none exists even then, no_plan.
- Budget: if the question carries a policy limit (for example maxRounds N: N rounds of forward chaining, each round applying every rule once to the facts known at its start) and the answer needs more work than the limit allows, answer status "budget_exhausted" with complete false and give only rows you have established; never present a cut-off answer as complete and never answer "unknown", "refuted" or "no_plan" because of a cut-off.
- If a question cannot be answered from the knowledge, say unknown. Never use outside knowledge. Do not guess.`;
