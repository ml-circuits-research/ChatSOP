/**
 * The behaviour of one conversation (DS023 "Behaviour layer", experiments/proposal/behaviour-layer.md): the user's standing
 * instructions, the turn counter and the last time each kind of reaction was used. It is caller-owned conversation state, persisted
 * with the conversation (server/session-store.mjs), and it only feeds the reasoner: code maps it to facts and to SOP data and never
 * chooses a reply.
 *
 *   emptyBehaviour()                                  -> {turn, instructions, history, reactions}
 *   applyInstructions(state, instructions, clock)     -> {facts, slots, changes}: set, cancel and list, recorded in the state
 *   overlayOf(state)                                  -> SOP text: one reply wire and one rule (origin user) per active instruction
 *   timeFacts(state, layerData, clock)                -> cv_turn_number, cv_turns_since, cv_seconds_since facts
 *   recordReactions(state, reply, layerData, clock)   the situations used by this reply (and their reaction kinds) are noted
 *
 * An instruction set by the user is behaviour data: a `reply` wire whose text is the user's own words and a `rule` that makes it
 * applicable on every turn (or a rule deriving a style). The JS oracle reads them with the conversation layer, so "from now on start
 * with ..." is followed because the layer's reasoning derives it, and "stop ..." withdraws the wires.
