input/seeds.json lists ${batch} facts of a small encyclopedia (Wikidata subset). Each seed has an index \`i\`, a \`predicate\` (the relation, with its role names), a \`subject\` and an \`object\`.
Write ONE question per seed, in the language given in \`language\`, that a curious person could type into a chat and whose answer is exactly that fact.

Rules:
- Ask for the object given the subject (a "what/who/where/when/which" question) or, for a few seeds (about one in five), ask for the subject given the object, or ask a yes/no question that names both.
- Vary the phrasing a lot. Do NOT reuse the predicate id; avoid always using the dictionary phrase of the relation. Use the wording real users use: synonyms, other verbs, passive, short forms, relative clauses ("the country whose capital is ..."), questions with a typo or lowercase names now and then (about one in ten).
- Name entities by their label from the seed (or a common short form the encyclopedia would surely know).
- One sentence, no preamble, no answer.

Write output/result.json: a JSON array of {"i": <seed index>, "question": "<text>"} with exactly one element per seed.

input/vocabulary.json is the relation vocabulary of a small encyclopedia (relation id, roles with types, label, a few phrasings). input/seeds.json lists ${batch} entity facts of the same encyclopedia (index \`i\`, \`predicate\`, \`subject\`, \`object\`).
For each seed write TWO short chat questions:
1. an AMBIGUOUS question about the seed's subject, in which a careful assistant that only has this vocabulary cannot tell which of two or more relations the user means, or which of two entities a name stands for (examples: "Who is the head of Alfa?" when both a head-of-government and a head-of-organization relation exist; "Is Ana in the choir?" membership versus location; a first name shared by two entities). Give the list of relation ids that are genuinely plausible in \`readings\` (at least two, taken from the vocabulary ids) or set \`entity_ambiguity\` to true.
2. a CLEAR question about the same subject that has exactly one natural reading and a unique relation of the vocabulary (\`reading\`: that relation id).
Do not make the ambiguous question contrived; real users write it that way.

Write output/result.json: a JSON array of {"i": <seed index>, "ambiguous": {"question": "...", "readings": ["id1","id2"], "entity_ambiguity": false}, "clear": {"question": "...", "reading": "id"}}.

${FENCE}
input/vocabulary.json is the relation vocabulary of a small encyclopedia: for each relation its id, roles (name:type), label, description and a few phrasings. input/questions.json lists ${batch} chat questions. Each has an index \`i\`, the \`question\`, and \`entity_candidates\`: entities whose name occurs in the question text (id, label, class); the list may be incomplete or contain wrong namesakes.
For every question decide, as a careful reader who only has this vocabulary and these candidates:
- \`relation\`: the id of the ONE relation the question asks about (the question may ask for the subject or the object; \`converse\` is true when the asked-for role is the grammatical subject of the relation as the vocabulary defines it). Use "none" when no relation of the vocabulary fits, "ambiguous" when two or more fit equally well and the user would have to say which (then list them in \`alternatives\`).
- \`entities\`: for every named entity in the question: {"surface": the words as written, "id": a candidate id, "none" when no candidate is the entity, or "ambiguous" when several candidates fit equally}.
- \`ask\`: true if an assistant must ask the user a clarifying question before it can answer (ambiguous relation or entity, or missing information); false if one reading is clearly the most natural.
- \`reason\`: at most 12 words.
Decide on meaning, not on word overlap. Prefer "none" over a forced fit.

Write output/result.json: a JSON array of {"i", "relation", "converse", "alternatives": [], "entities": [{"surface","id"}], "ask", "reason"} with exactly one element per question.
