/**
 * Evaluation hygiene of the query-forms dev set (AGENTS.md direction 9): the dev questions are the same forms as the sealed KBQA
 * test questions with different words. Fails closed (exit 1) when a dev question is a normalized duplicate of a KBQA test question or
 * shares (nearly) all its content words with one; the offending rows are listed and written to --drop so the dev set can be pruned.
 *   node tools/eval/query-forms/overlap.mjs --dev dev.jsonl [--drop ids.json] [--min-words 3] [--jaccard 0.7]
 * Reads the sealed test files only as a validator does (the dev generator never sees them).
