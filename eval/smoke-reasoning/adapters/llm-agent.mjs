/**
 * Adapters for the BASELINE strategy `llm-agent` (reasoning/strategies/llm-agent/): an LLM run through omp that works through the problem.
 * Two variants, `llm-agent-sop` (the knowledge and query circuits as SOP text with the semantics attached) and `llm-agent-nl` (the
 * natural-language `source.md` of the case; cases without one are not expressible for it). Both are registered but run ONLY when
 * `SMOKE_LLM=1` is set, so the default smoke stays free and deterministic. The model is `LLM_AGENT_MODEL` (default: config/llm-agent.json).
 *
 * Its answers are advisory: the harness compares them with the oracle, they are never ground truth. The adapter is `raw`: the harness does not
 * wrap it in the two-run conditional list, the closed-world policy or the retrieval widening, because the model is asked for the final answer itself
 * (wrapping would repair or multiply its answers and mask its errors). On retrieval cases it sees the needed slice, not the distractors (perfect retrieval).
