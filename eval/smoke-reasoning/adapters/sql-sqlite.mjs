/**
 * Adapter for the product strategy `sql-sqlite` (reasoning/strategies/sql-sqlite/): the desugared core compiled to SQL and run by the
 * built-in node:sqlite. It hands the knowledge and query circuits of the case, as text, to the strategy, which uses the oracle's own
 * front end (governance, desugaring, program compiler) and lowers the rest to tables, INSERT ... SELECT, recursive CTEs, a semi-naive
 * loop, NOT EXISTS and GROUP BY. Per-row `conditional` is the host rule applied by the harness around every strategy.
