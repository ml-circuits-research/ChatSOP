/**
 * Adapter for the `prolog-tabling` strategy (reasoning/strategies/prolog-tabling/): SLG resolution in the private SWI-Prolog.
 * It lowers nothing: the knowledge and query circuits go, as text, to the strategy, which compiles the desugared core to a tabled
 * Prolog program. A circuit that needs a feature the strategy declares unsupported is `not_expressible`, never weakened.
