/**
 * Adapter for the product strategy `asp-clingo` (reasoning/strategies/asp-clingo/): the desugared core lowered to ASP and run by
 * clingo 5.8.2 as a subprocess. The strategy parses the circuits itself; `conditional` is left to the harness (the same host rule
 * around every strategy). `used` is computed by the strategy's deletion method only for cases that state a support set, so the
 * harness replays it in the oracle.
