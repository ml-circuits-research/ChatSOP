// The effects of a TaskLambda: what a call may do besides computing its output. Every TaskLambda declares them (REQUIRED): either
// `['pure']`, or a list of effect kinds. The declaration is checked where TinyAgent can check it (the tools of the agent, the model
// client and the job functions given to a server TaskLambda refuse an undeclared effect) and decides result reuse: only a `pure`
// TaskLambda's output is reused for the same hash, parameters and input files; a call with effects is never replayed, only audited.
//
//   pure            no effect: the output depends only on the parameters and the files or attachments read (recorded with hashes)
//   writes-workdir  writes, moves or deletes files of the work folder (each one in the call's effects.jsonl, with before/after hashes)
//   model-calls     calls models through TinyAgent (each call in the call's models.jsonl)
//   runs-scripts    runs a declared script of an Agent Skill (trusted code; its own writes are not observed, the run is recorded)
//   runs-jobs       starts job runs or tasks (child calls)
//   writes-external writes outside the work folder and the call folder (a project store, a repository path); declared by trusted code
//   network         direct network access: none is allowed today, so a TaskLambda declaring it is refused
// A call always writes its own call folder (outputs, logs); that is not an effect.
