/**
 * Answer formulation in the user's language (DS009 "Answer language"). The request parser reads any language and writes English
 * circuits; the runtime reasons in English and `sop/answer-text.mjs` renders the answer deterministically in English. This optional
 * final step phrases that answer in the language of the user's message with the default model through the proxy (the providers of
 * `answerLanguage.providers`, by default the proxy tier `tiny` (the local Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, a short rewriting task) then `small`; never omp), strictly from the result: the English answer and a compact copy of the result
 * packet (status, answers, count, the facts used and their sources). The model adds no fact; every number and every source id of the
 * English answer must appear in its text, otherwise the English answer is returned. The English rendering is always kept in the trace.
 *
 * Natural phrasing (DS023 "Conversation layer", owner 2026-10-02: "less robotic, more natural"): the reply chosen from the conversation
 * layer and filled from the packet is the DRAFT; for an English message the same step rewrites it as a natural chat reply (varied
 * wording, lists as sentences, no "Answer:" label) under the same rules (no new fact; numbers, source ids and the names of the draft
 * kept). The draft stays the fallback and is kept in the trace.
 *
 * Settings (`answerLanguage` of config/runtime.json): `mode` `auto` (the default: on when the message does not look English; for English
 * the `natural` setting decides), `always` or `off`; `natural` `all` (the default: every English reply is phrased naturally),
 * `conversation` (only replies with a conversation-layer part besides the answer) or `off`; `timeoutSeconds` (default 25, the budget of the whole step).
 * `looksEnglish` is also the hook for local formalization strategies: the request parser receives `messageLanguage` (`en` or `other`)
 * and may translate a non-English message to English before a small local model reads it.
